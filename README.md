## Election-Audit Summary
  Although the script is already specific, certain modifications can be made where we could even get information that tells us what percentage of county voted for each candidate. Another way the script can be modified in the future is it can be used to determine which way populationn in certain provinces or states may vote, instead of counties, opening it up for information for federal elections.
